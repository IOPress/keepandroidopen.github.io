In August 2025, Google announced that starting next year,
it will no longer be possible to develop apps for the Android platform
without first registering centrally with Google. This registration will involve:

- Paying a fee to Google
- Agreeing to their terms and conditions
- Providing government identification for the developer
- Uploading evidence of an app's private signing key
- Listing all current and future application identifiers


Some actions you can take to help support the opposition are:
